# --- Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! ---

# Let's design a Smartphone class.
# This is the parent class.

# Now, let's create a child class using inheritance.
# This is a subclass of Smartphone, inheriting all its attributes and methods.

# Now, let's demonstrate polymorphism!
# We create a list containing different types of objects,
# but they all belong to a shared parent class (Vehicle).
vehicles = [Car(), Plane(), Boat(), Vehicle()]

print("--- Activity 2: Polymorphism in Action ---")
# We can loop through the list and call the same method (move()) on each object.
# Python automatically knows which version of move() to call based on the object's type.
# This is the power of polymorphism!
